```

### Test Display:

5. Resize browser → Different size loads
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Image sizes can be customized in `app/Services/ResponsiveImageService.php`:

```php
protected $sizes = [
    'small' => 480,    // Change as needed
    'medium' => 768,   // Change as needed
    'large' => 1200,   // Change as needed
    'xl' => 1920,      // Change as needed
];
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Images not resizing?**
```bash
# Check GD/Imagick is installed
php -m | grep -i gd

# Check storage permissions
chmod -R 775 storage/
```

**2. Wrong size loading?**
- Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Check srcset in browser inspector

**3. Upload fails?**
```bash
# Check PHP upload limits
php -i | grep upload_max_filesize
php -i | grep post_max_size

# Increase in php.ini if needed
upload_max_filesize = 10M
post_max_size = 10M
```
