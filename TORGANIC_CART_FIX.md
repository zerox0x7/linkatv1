# Torganic Theme - Add to Cart Functionality Fix

## Summary
Fixed the "Add to Basket" functionality in the Torganic theme. The issue was that the add to cart forms were missing required fields expected by the CartController.

## Problem Identified
The add to cart forms in the Torganic theme were using:
```html
<form action="{{ route('cart.add', $product->id) }}" method="POST">
    @csrf
    <button type="submit">أضف للسلة</button>
</form>
```

However, the CartController's `addItem` method expects the following POST parameters:
- `product_id` (required|integer)
- `product_type` (required|in:product,digital_card)
- `quantity` (integer|min:1)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Add to Cart Forms
Updated all add to cart forms in the following files to include required fields:

#### Files Modified:
- `resources/views/themes/torganic/pages/home.blade.php`
- `resources/views/themes/torganic/pages/products/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/themes/torganic/pages/products/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/themes/torganic/pages/products/search.blade.php`
- `resources/views/themes/torganic/pages/category/show.blade.php`

#### New Form Structure:
```html
<form action="{{ route('cart.add') }}" method="POST" class="d-inline">
    @csrf
    <input type="hidden" name="product_id" value="{{ $product->id }}">
    <input type="hidden" name="product_type" value="product">
    <input type="hidden" name="quantity" value="1">
    <button type="submit" class="trk-btn trk-btn--outline">أضف للسلة</button>
</form>
```

### 2. Added AJAX Functionality
Enhanced `resources/views/themes/torganic/layouts/app.blade.php` with:

#### Features Added:
- **AJAX Form Submission**: Add to cart without page reload
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner and disables button during submission
- **Success Feedback**: 
  - Green success notification at top-right corner
  - Button changes to "تمت الإضافة" with checkmark for 2 seconds
  - Auto-updates cart count badge in header
- **Error Handling**: Shows error notification if something goes wrong
- **Cart Count Update**: Automatically syncs cart count in header badges

#### JavaScript Features:
```javascript
// Automatically handles all add to cart forms
// Shows notifications with auto-dismiss
// Updates cart counter in header
// Provides visual feedback on buttons
```

### 3. Cart Counter Integration
The existing CartManager in the header is now properly integrated:
- Cart badges automatically show when items are added
- Cart badges hide when count reaches 0
- Smooth animation when count updates

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "أضف للسلة"** (Add to Cart)
2. **Form submits via AJAX** to `/cart/add` endpoint
3. **Button shows loading** state with spinner
4. **Server processes request** and returns JSON response
5. **Success notification appears** at top-right corner
6. **Cart count updates** in header badge
7. **Button shows success** state briefly then returns to normal

## Testing Checklist

✅ Home page - Popular products section  
✅ Home page - New arrivals section  
✅ Home page - Featured products section  
✅ Home page - Flash sale section  
✅ Products listing page  
✅ Product detail page  
✅ Product search results  
✅ Category page

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: No page reload when adding to cart
2. **Instant Feedback**: Users see confirmation immediately
3. **Cart Count Updates**: Header badge updates in real-time
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if something goes wrong
5. **Loading States**: Users know when action is processing
6. **Mobile Friendly**: Works on all devices

## Technical Details

### CartController Validation
```php
$request->validate([
    'product_id' => 'required|integer',
    'product_type' => 'required|in:product,digital_card',
    'quantity' => 'integer|min:1',
]);
```

### JSON Response Format
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "تمت إضافة المنتج إلى سلة التسوق",
    "cart_count": 3,
    "cart_total": 150.00,
    "product_name": "منتج عضوي"
}
```

## Notes

- All forms now work consistently across the theme
- The quantity selector on product detail page is properly integrated
- Cart synchronization happens automatically
- No conflicts with existing cart management code
- Backwards compatible with existing functionality

## Additional Fixes Applied

### 4. Cart Page Data Issue
**Problem**: Cart icon showed count but cart page was empty.

**Root Cause**: The cart page was not receiving the correct data from the controller.

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed `CartController::index()` method to pass `$cartItems` variable
- Added proper cart totals calculation (`$subtotal`, `$shipping`, `$discount`, `$total`)
- Updated cart view to use `$item->cartable` instead of `$item->product`
- Added `getSubtotal()` method to Cart model
- Enhanced session persistence with `session()->save()`
- Added debugging logs to track cart data

### 5. Session Persistence Enhancement
**Problem**: Cart items were being added but not persisting between requests.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `session()->save()` calls to force session persistence
- Enhanced debugging to track session data
- Added debug route `/debug-session` for troubleshooting
