# Torganic Checkout Page Fix

## Problem
The Torganic checkout page was not working properly and was not displaying cart items correctly. The page was trying to access `$item->product` instead of `$item->cartable`, and was not using the same data structure as the working GreenGame checkout.

## Solution
Updated the Torganic checkout page to work exactly like the GreenGame checkout but with Torganic styling:

### 1. Fixed Data Access
- Changed `$item->product` to `$item->cartable` to match the polymorphic relationship
- Updated cart items loop to use `$cart->items` instead of `$cartItems`
- Fixed price calculations to use `$item->price` instead of `$item->product->price`

### 2. Updated Totals Calculation
- Changed to use `$cart->getSubtotal()` and `$cart->getTotal()` methods
- Added support for coupon discounts from session
- Set shipping to "مجاني" (free) to match GreenGame

### 3. Dynamic Payment Methods
- Replaced hardcoded payment methods with dynamic `$paymentMethods` from controller
- Added support for payment method logos
- Added balance display for balance payment method
- Added proper error handling when no payment methods are available

### 4. Custom Product Data Support
- Added support for displaying custom product data (player_data)
- Added support for displaying service options
- Added proper styling for custom data sections

### 5. Form Action Fix
- Changed form action from `checkout.store` to `checkout.process` to match the controller

### 6. Enhanced Styling
- Added custom CSS for payment method selection
- Added hover effects for payment methods
- Added active state styling for selected payment method
- Added styling for custom product data display
- Added proper spacing and visual hierarchy

### 7. JavaScript Enhancements
- Added payment method selection handling
- Added visual feedback for selected payment methods
- Maintained existing form validation
