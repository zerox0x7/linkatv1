## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive RTL (Right-to-Left) improvements made to the Torganic theme's home page for better Arabic language support.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Main RTL Container**

```css
- Section headers aligned to the right
- Sale banner content aligned to the right

```
